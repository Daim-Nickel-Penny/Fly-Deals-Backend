# Flight Fare Predictor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

## Introduction
Flight ticket costs, as we all know, may be difficult to predict.
As a result, we attempted to forecast the pricing for future trip dates.
To do so, we used web scraped data from my journey to make the forecast.

## Steps done-

- 1. EDA for extracting the possible features, trends in data and detecting outliers.
- 2. Feature Extraction
- 3. Feature Selection using FFS and Ensemble Learning
- 4. Test
- 5. Prediction
